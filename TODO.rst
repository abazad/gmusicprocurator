TODO
====

In no particular order:

* Play queue:

  + `persist`_ (via indexeddb? localstorage is probably too limited)

* Design tweaks
* `Scrobbling`_?
* Ability to play filesystem music?
* Better docs/setup story (wizard?)
* Multi-user?
* `Python 3.3+ support`_ - requires the following packages to release compatible
  versions:

  * mutagen (as of 1.25)
  * gmusicapi

    * oauth2client (as of 1.4)
    * protobuf
