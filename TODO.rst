TODO
====

In no particular order:

* Play queue:

  + persist (via indexeddb? localstorage is probably too limited)

* Design tweaks
* Ability to play filesystem music?
* Better docs/setup story (wizard?)
* Multi-user?
* Python 3.3+ support - requires the following packages to release compatible
  versions:

  * mutagen (as of 2014-04-05, support in hg)
  * gmusicapi

    * oauth2client
    * protobuf
